## Difference between Value Type and Reference Types

- **Value types** stored in `stack`, directly hold data in memory.
- **Reference types** stored in `heap`, hold a reference to the data in `heap`.

### GetHashCode() method

- Generates a hash code that uniquely identifies the object instance.
- For value types, it computes the hash based on the values.

```csharp
int [] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int num = 20;
Console.WriteLine(arr.GetHashCode());  // 32854180
Console.WriteLine(num.GetHashCode()); // 20
```

### Knowing type of variable using `GetType`

- Use `GetType` method to get type of variable
- Use `MinValue`, `MaxValue` properties to know min and max values of this type

```csharp
int x = 10;
Console.WriteLine(x);  // 10
Console.WriteLine(x.GetType()); // System.Int32
Console.WriteLine(sizeof(Int32));  // 4
Console.WriteLine(Int32.MinValue);  // -2147483648
Console.WriteLine(Int32.MaxValue); // 2147483647
```

## Structures

- Struct is a `value type` that can encapsulate data and related functionalities.
- So structs stored in stack
- Structs have a default constructor, without any parameters provided by C#, which used to initialize struct members with their default types (i.e. `int` member will be initialized by its default value which is `0`)
- Structs in C# **can't** have an **implicit non-parameterized constructor**
- Structs in C# can have an **implicit parameterized constructor**, but you **must initialize all fields** within the constructor
- Structs in C# can have more than one **implicit parameterized constructor** with different parameter list
- Structs members can be initialized manually
- Structs in C# can't support inheritance, i.e. (structs can't derive from other structs, and also can't be a base for other structs)
- Structs implicitly inherited from the base `Object` class, so it has some behaviors like (`ToString()`, `GetHashCode()`, `Equals()`)
- Structs have a good performance because it's fully stored in stack
- Structs members and methods by default **private**

```csharp
public struct Coords
{
	public double X;
	public double Y;
    public Coords(double x, double y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
}
```

```csharp
Coords c1 = new Coords();
Console.WriteLine(c1.X); // 0
Console.WriteLine(c1.Y); // 0
c1.X = 20;
Console.WriteLine(c1.X); // 20
```

> [!Tip]
>
> - Use `cw` snippet to quickly write `Console.WriteLine`
> - Use `ctor` snippet to quickly create default constructor for struct

### Indexer

- Struct can have an indexer but only if this struct contains array of structs

**Syntax**:

```csharp
public return_value_type this[indexer_data_type index_name] {
	set {
		// handle setter case
		// use `value` => refers to assigned value to the indexer
	}
	get {
		// handle getter case
	}
}
```
